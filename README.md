# Drug Consumption Predictor
This project addresses the critical issue of narcotic drug abuse among youth, particularly within educational institutions. Our model, utilizes machine learning algorithms like Gaussian Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression and achieved an impressive 99% accuracy in identifying cocaine use from a dataset of 1,884 entries and 19 drugs. The model employs a user-friendly interface for inputting medical and personal data to predict drug consumption probabilities. By accurately identifying at-risk students, educational institutions can take timely actions such as referrals to rehabilitation centers. This project highlights the potential of AI in combating drug abuse and underscores the importance of preventive measures in fostering a healthier, drug-free environment for students. Keywords: narcotic drugs, youth generation, Drug Reception Validator, machine learning algorithm, drug prediction, cocaine detection, drug abuse prevention.
